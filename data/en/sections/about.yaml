# Resumen de ti
summary: "Hi, my name’s Elisa and I’m a 21 year old Mexican woman. I’m currently on my sixth semester of Engineering in Data Science and Mathematics at Tecnológico de Monterrey. I chose this career because a I like maths and I enjoy programming. My main objective in this field is to perform statistical and trend analysis within an organization to improve its performance using programming tools and machine learning. I am a disciplined young woman, perseverant and optimistic when facing complicated situations with a special interest in artificial intelligence models for the generation of solutions and strategies that benefit a company or organization. Apart from my career, physical activities are a very important part of my everyday life. I’ve practiced sports such as ballet and figure skating since I was a little girl and now I enjoy weight training, running and yoga. I also enjoy reading, specially novels and biographies about relevant athletes. Lastly, I’m very interested in mindfulness in order tu have a stable mental health and better relationships with myself and my loved ones."
